## How I Work

I focus on paid client work—custom development, consulting engagements, and technical projects. My time is allocated to active projects, and I don't offer free consultations, exploratory calls, or "pick your brain" sessions.

This isn't about being unfriendly—it's about delivering quality work. [Paul Graham](https://twitter.com/paulg) explains in his essay on [the maker's schedule](http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) how fragmented time destroys deep work. [Ryan Holiday](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday) wrote about [everyone who asks for "just a little" of your time](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2017/01/to-everyone-who-asks-for-just-a-little-of-your-time)—it adds up fast.

My priorities are family first, client work second, and personal time for what's left. If you have a legitimate project, use the contact pathways above. I respond promptly to serious inquiries.
