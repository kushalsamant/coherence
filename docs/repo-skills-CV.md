## WHAT THIS PERSON IS **UNIQUELY GOOD AT**

### **The Rare Combo:**
Most developers are either:
- AI/ML engineers (can't build products)
- Web developers (don't understand AI)
- Product designers (can't code)

**This portfolio proves capability in ALL THREE:**

1. ✅ **Can implement AI/ML from scratch** (not just API calls)
2. ✅ **Can build production web apps** (auth, payments, deployment)
3. ✅ **Understands creator economy** (Instagram formats, tone adaptation, freemium)

**This combination is RARE** - maybe 1-5% of developers have all three.
