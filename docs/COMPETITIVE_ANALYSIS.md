## 1. Perse.io Analysis

### Company Overview
**Perse Technology Ltd** (perse.io) is a UK-based company founded in 2020 that offers an **open energy platform** designed to automate financial and carbon savings for grid-connected devices.

### Business Model
- **Industry:** Energy/Utilities (NOT research/content platform)
- **Target Market:** Businesses and consumers with grid-connected assets (buildings, vehicles, energy systems)
- **Core Offering:** Real-time energy and carbon data analytics with automated optimization recommendations
- **Revenue Model:** Likely B2B SaaS (pricing not publicly disclosed)

### Key Features
- Real-time energy, carbon, and cost data for connected assets
- Automated recommendations for cost and carbon reduction
- API integration for clients' products
- Perse Hub (user-friendly platform)
- White-label products
- Marketplace connecting users with service providers

### Strategic Partnerships

- Founding partner of Perseus program (greenhouse gas reporting for SMEs)

### Technology Stack
- Calendly, Cloudflare, jsDelivr, jQuery, Webflow
- HTTP/3, Open Graph, HSTS

### Competitive Assessment
**❌ NOT A DIRECT COMPETITOR**

Perse.io operates in a completely different industry (energy/utilities) and does not compete with any KVSHVL platform projects:
- **Not competing with ASK:** Perse.io focuses on energy data, not research Q&A
- **Not competing with Sketch2BIM:** Perse.io focuses on energy optimization, not architectural BIM conversion
- **Not competing with Reframe:** Perse.io focuses on carbon/energy analytics, not content tone adjustment

**Conclusion:** Perse.io is not relevant to KVSHVL platform competitive analysis. The similarity in name appears to be coincidental.
