        <h1>Kushal Samant</h1>
        
        <p>I'm an architect licensed in India. I solve spatial problems by working through them with people. Sometimes I know the answer going in, often I don't. We figure it out together.</p>
        
        <p>I've worked on around 150+ projects over the past decade—residential, commercial, cultural spaces, teaching architecture, some digital work. You can see the <a href="https://kushalsamant.github.io/projects.html">full list here</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>How I Work</h2>
        
        <p>Transparently. This website is built on <a href="https://github.com/kushalsamant" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub</a> so you can see how it evolves. I document the process, not just the results. When I hit challenges, I share them. When I'm learning something new, I say so.</p>
        
        <p>I bring experience from architecture practice, teaching at Dr D.Y. Patil School of Architecture, international competitions, and a lot of bootstrapped projects where I had to figure things out as I went. That breadth means I can look at problems from multiple angles.</p>

            <p>"Memento Mori, Amor Fati."</p>
            <cite>Marcus Aurelius</cite>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>The Stoic approach shapes how I work: being mindful of time, transparent about what we can control, and accountable for the process. It's not philosophy as decoration—it's about how we actually collaborate.</p>
        
        <h2>A Few Projects</h2>
        
        <p><strong><a href="https://kushalsamant.github.io/projects/bridging_emotions.html">Bridging Emotions</a></strong> — Architectural thesis exploring space design around Mumbai's Sea Link to address citywide clinical depression. Figuring out how architecture could respond to mental health at urban scale.</p>
        
        <p><strong><a href="https://kushalsamant.github.io/projects/farmhouse_savaroli.html">Farmhouse, Savaroli</a></strong> — Working with clients who had a site and ideas but needed someone to help resolve the spatial and functional realities.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The Hive Black Box Theatres</strong> — Multiple locations in Mumbai. Performance spaces where the constraints (budget, existing buildings, timelines) required creative problem-solving with the client team.</p>
        
        <p>See the <a href="https://kushalsamant.github.io/projects.html">full project list</a> for everything from international competitions to actual built work to teaching roles.</p>
        
        <h2>This Website</h2>
        
        <p>No tracking, no analytics, no unnecessary scripts. Just content. It's fast, respects your bandwidth, and doesn't collect your data. Built this way because it aligns with how I think about design—stripping away what's not needed.</p>
