        <p>Privacy-focused analytics to improve the site. No invasive tracking, no data sold. Built lean because it aligns with how I think about design—stripping away what's not needed.</p>
        
        <h1>Kushal Samant</h1>
        
        <p>I'm an architect licensed in India. I solve spatial problems by working through them with people. Sometimes I know the answer going in, often I don't. We figure it out together.</p>
        
        <p>I've worked on around 150+ projects over the past decade—residential, commercial, cultural spaces, teaching architecture, some digital work. You can see the <a href="https://kushalsamant.github.io/projects.html">full list here</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>How I Work</h2>
        
        <p>Transparently. This website is built on <a href="https://github.com/kushalsamant" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub</a> so you can see how it evolves. I document the process, not just the results. When I hit challenges, I share them. When I'm learning something new, I say so.</p>
        
        <p>I bring experience from architecture practice, teaching at Dr D.Y. Patil School of Architecture, international competitions, and a lot of bootstrapped projects where I had to figure things out as I went. That breadth means I can look at problems from multiple angles.</p>

        </blockquote>
        
        <p>The Stoic approach shapes how I work: being mindful of time, transparent about what we can control, and accountable for the process. It's not philosophy as decoration—it's about how we actually collaborate.</p>
