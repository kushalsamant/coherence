# Get in Touch

If you'd like to reach out—whether it's to say hello, share feedback, ask a question, or talk through an idea—I'd love to hear from you. The easiest way to connect is on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/kvshvl){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, where I try to respond to as many messages as I can.

I know that's not as satisfying as direct email, but my inbox is a mess. When I made it public, too many messages came in and went unread—that sucks for everyone.

## Boundaries & Philosophy

If you want to connect personally, have a business idea to discuss, want to share something you made, or want me involved in a project—anything that requires a time commitment—I very gently have to say no. Saying no is hard.

So many extraordinary circumstances should warrant a yes, but I can't. It's a hard, inflexible no.

Family comes first, work second, and whatever's left I use for myself (usually travel). There's no time left for yes, even if that means missing opportunities.

[Paul Graham](https://twitter.com/paulg) explains why saying yes to "quick coffee" destroys the creative process—read his essay on [the maker's schedule](http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html). [Ryan Holiday](https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday) wrote [this pointed piece](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2017/01/to-everyone-who-asks-for-just-a-little-of-your-time) about everyone who asks for "just a little" of your time.

It's brilliant. I wish I'd written it. I'm sorry for the no, but it's not without reason.

## The Solution: Structured Consultations

For deeper conversations—business ideas, project collaborations, sharing what you've made, or anything requiring focused time and energy—the best way to connect is through a **1:1 consultation**. This ensures I can give you my undivided attention without inbox chaos or schedule interruptions.

### 1:1 Consultation – TL;DR

Here's the quick version:

- ✅ Pay upfront → your slot is confirmed
- ✅ Cancel **48 hrs in advance** → full refund
- ✅ Reschedule **24 hrs in advance** → no extra cost
- ❌ No-shows or late arrivals → no refund
- 🛡️ Everything we discuss stays confidential
- ⚖️ I'm only liable up to the fee you paid
- 📜 Governed by Indian law (Sindhudurg jurisdiction)

If that works for you, we'll get along fine. You can also [read the full Terms of Service](https://kushalsamant.github.io/termsofservice.html).
